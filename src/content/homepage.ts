    question: "Do you help with insurance claims after storm damage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We inspect and document the damage thoroughly, provide the reports and photos your insurance company needs, and can meet your adjuster on site. The claim decision always rests with your insurer, but you won't navigate the process alone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I choose metal or shingle roofing?",
    answer:
      "It depends on your structure, budget, and goals. Architectural shingles are the most cost-effective option up front; metal systems typically cost more initially but offer a longer service life and excellent wind performance. We install both, so our recommendation is based on your roof — not on what we happen to sell.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a roof replacement take?",
    answer:
      "Most residential replacements are completed in one to two days once materials arrive, depending on the size and complexity of the roof. Commercial projects vary with the system and square footage — we provide a schedule with every estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the inspection really free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We inspect your roof, document what we find, and give you a straight answer — including when the right answer is a small repair instead of a replacement.",
  },
