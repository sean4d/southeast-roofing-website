            South Mississippi is hard on roofs. Gulf humidity, brutal summer
            heat, and a hurricane season that runs half the year mean a roof
            here doesn&apos;t just need to look good on day one — it has to be
            built for the next storm. That reality shapes everything about how
            we work: the systems we install, the way we flash and ventilate,
            and the way we document our jobs.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            We&apos;re deliberately not a one-trick shop. About half our work
            is storm and insurance restoration, and half is retail — families
            and building owners who simply want the best roof for their money.
            We install architectural shingle, standing-seam and panel metal,
            TPO, EPDM, and coating systems, which means our recommendation
            starts with your building and your budget, not with the one
            product we know how to sell.
