/**
 * Data-driven config for the Roof Color Visualizer. EDIT HERE to add products
 * or colors. Hexes are close approximations for the swatches.
 *
 * Photo priority (see visualizer.tsx) — the visualizer shows, in order:
 *   1. a REAL Southeast Roofing job photo of that product + color (matched
 *      from content/photos.ts, or a live Sanity upload), badged "Real job";
 *   2. otherwise a manufacturer product `sample` photo, if one is set below,
 *      badged "Product sample" (an honest placeholder);
 *   3. otherwise the flat hex swatch.
 *
 * This makes the placeholders self-retiring: the moment we install and log a
 * roof in that color (static file or form/Sanity upload), the real roof
 * automatically replaces the product sample — no code change needed. Color
 * names here must match the color names in content/photos.ts exactly.
