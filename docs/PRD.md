# Southeast Roofing — Website Blueprint / PRD

**Project:** Southeast Roofing flagship website & long-term digital platform
**Primary live domain:** southeastroofing.llc
**Secondary domain:** roofs.ms (currently 301 redirects → southeastroofing.llc)
**Company base:** Hattiesburg, Mississippi — residential & commercial roofing within ~2 hours of Hattiesburg
**Status:** Draft v2 — awaiting owner approval before development begins

---

## 0. Vision & Goals

### 0.1 Immediate goals (in priority order)

1. **Generate roofing leads** — residential and commercial; every page drives toward a call, inspection request, or commercial consultation.
2. **Look more premium and trustworthy than local competitors** — cinematic, high-end contractor brand, not a template.
3. **Rank heavily in Google for local roofing searches** — service pages × location pages, schema, Core Web Vitals, long-term topical authority.
4. **Equal emphasis on commercial and residential** — a dedicated commercial experience, not a single commercial page.
5. **Flashy, modern, animated — without sacrificing speed or SEO.** Motion is a brand asset, never a performance tax.

### 0.2 Long-term vision (5+ years): the digital platform

This project is the foundation of Southeast Roofing's digital platform, not a disposable brochure site. The architecture must accommodate — without rewrites — the later addition of:

| Future capability | Architectural implication now |
|---|---|
| Customer portal (project status, documents, warranty records) | Reserved route group, auth-ready layout shell, DB introduced when needed |
| Employee portal (crew schedules, job docs) | Same auth foundation, role-based access pattern |
| Online scheduling | Booking flow slots into the existing lead-intake API layer |
| Financing tools (calculator → application) | Calculator ships as interactive feature; application flow integrates partner APIs later |
| AI customer assistant | Content modeled as structured data (CMS) so an assistant can ground on it; chat UI slots into layout |
| Commercial project portfolio & case studies | Case-study content type modeled in CMS from day one |
| Project-management integrations (JobNimbus, AccuLynx, etc.) | Lead intake built as a service layer with webhook/adapter pattern, not a hardcoded email |
| Blog & learning center | CMS-driven from launch; topical authority plan (§10) |
| Careers page | Simple at first; job-posting content type + `JobPosting` schema ready |
| CRM integrations | Same adapter pattern as PM integrations; leads stored, not just emailed |

**Guiding principle:** build the marketing site now, but make every hard-to-reverse choice (content model, route structure, lead pipeline, auth readiness) as if the platform features are coming — because they are.

**Integrity rule (non-negotiable):** No fake reviews, fake license numbers, fake awards, fake certifications, or fake guarantees anywhere on the site. Wherever real proof is required, the spec marks it `[NEEDS: …]` and the build uses clearly-labeled placeholders until the owner supplies the real asset.

---

## 1. Domain Strategy

**Current production setup — do not change without explicit owner decision:**

- **Primary:** `https://southeastroofing.llc` — the live, canonical domain. All canonical URLs, schema, sitemaps, and GBP references point here.
- **Secondary:** `https://roofs.ms` — 301 redirects to southeastroofing.llc.

**Implementation requirements:**

- Both domains attach to the Vercel project; the redirect is configured at the platform/domain level (not in-app), preserving paths (`roofs.ms/services/x` → `southeastroofing.llc/services/x`).
- The codebase must be **domain-agnostic**: the canonical host lives in a single environment variable / config value (`SITE_URL`) consumed by metadata, canonical tags, sitemap, robots, OG URLs, and JSON-LD. If the owner later decides to flip primary domains, the change is: one config value + swap the redirect direction + re-verify in Search Console. No content or code edits.
- No hardcoded domain strings anywhere in components or content.
- Search Console: both domains verified; sitemap submitted for the primary only.

## 3. Homepage — Section-by-Section Plan

The homepage now serves **two audiences**: homeowners and commercial decision-makers. It leads residential (higher volume) but gives commercial a first-class, above-the-fold-adjacent path.

| # | Section | Purpose & Motion |
|---|---------|------------------|
| 1 | **Hero** | Full-viewport dark cinematic hero `[NEEDS: hero media]`. Headline: premium South Mississippi roofing. Dual CTAs: **Call Now** + **Schedule Free Inspection**. Third quiet link: "Commercial project? Start here →" routing to /commercial. Parallax background, staggered text reveal, trust chips (licensed & insured `[NEEDS: license #]`, local, year founded `[NEEDS: year]`). |
| 2 | **Trust bar** | Animated count-up stats: rating `[NEEDS: source]`, roofs completed `[NEEDS: count]`, years in business, certifications `[NEEDS: real certs]`. |
| 3 | **Residential / Commercial split** | Two large cinematic panels side by side — "Residential Roofing" / "Commercial Roofing" — equal visual weight, hover-expand effect, each routing to its experience. This is the structural statement that we do both, seriously. |
| 4 | **Services grid** | 6–8 primary service cards (replacement, repair, storm, metal, emergency, inspections, gutters, insurance help). Hover lift + metallic border glow, staggered scroll-in. |
| 5 | **Emergency strip** | Burgundy band: "Storm damage? Leaking now?" + **24/7 Emergency Call** `[NEEDS: confirm availability]`. Subtle pulse. |
| 6 | **Metal roofing feature** | Dedicated showcase band for the metal category: standing-seam imagery, style chips (standing seam, R-panel, barndominium…), "Explore Metal Roofing" → /metal-roofing. Metal is a growth flagship and gets homepage real estate. |
| 7 | **Why Southeast Roofing** | Split layout, parallax image, 4–5 real differentiators (local & owner-operated, materials, clean sites, communication, warranty `[NEEDS: terms]`). |
| 8 | **Before / After showcase** | Interactive draggable sliders (2–3 projects) `[NEEDS: photo pairs]`. |
| 9 | **Process timeline** | Inspection → Estimate → (Insurance help) → Build day → Walkthrough & warranty. Scroll-drawn timeline. |
| 10 | **Commercial spotlight** | Building-owner-focused band: industries served (schools, churches, apartments, industrial, warehouses, municipal) as icon chips, featured commercial project `[NEEDS: commercial photos]`, CTA → /commercial/request-consultation. |
| 11 | **Insurance & financing strip** | Two panels: claims help + financing `[NEEDS: financing partner/terms]`, each with CTA. |
| 12 | **Featured projects** | 3–6 gallery cards (mix residential + commercial), hover zoom, → /projects. |
| 13 | **Reviews** | Real reviews only `[NEEDS: reviews + permission]`; until supplied, link-out panel to live Google profile `[NEEDS: GBP URL]`. |
| 14 | **Service-area map** | Stylized dark interactive map, animated pins, 2-hour radius ring (see §7 Interactive Features), city links. |
| 15 | **FAQ** | 5–7 questions, smooth accordion, FAQPage schema. |
| 16 | **Final CTA band** | Cinematic band + short quote form (name, phone, zip, residential/commercial toggle) + call button. |
| 17 | **Footer** | 5 columns: Residential Services, Commercial, Service Areas, Company (about/reviews/financing/careers/learn), Contact + hours + license `[NEEDS: #]` + socials `[NEEDS: profiles]`. |

**Persistent elements (all pages):** sticky condensing header (logo, nav with Residential / Commercial / Metal / Service Areas / Learn, phone, "Free Inspection" button); sticky mobile bottom bar (**Call** + **Free Inspection**; on /commercial routes it swaps to **Call** + **Request Consultation**); toggleable storm-event banner slot.

---

## 4. Service Page Structure

### 4.1 Residential/core service template (unchanged from v1, 11 sections)

1. Service hero (breadcrumb, dual CTA, service imagery `[NEEDS: per-service photos]`)
2. Intro — what/who/why it matters in South Mississippi (heat, humidity, hurricane season); unique copy per service
3. "Signs you need this" icon list
4. What's included / our approach
5. Materials & options where relevant `[NEEDS: brands/products used]`
6. Before/After or gallery strip (filtered to service)
7. Insurance & financing panel (contextual weight)
8. Service-specific FAQ (FAQPage schema)
9. Related services (3 cards)
10. Service-area links ("We provide {service} in: …")
11. Final CTA band

**Emergency page additions:** 24/7 CTA above fold, "what to do right now" checklist, tarping/mitigation explainer.
**Insurance page additions:** step-by-step claims walkthrough, "we meet your adjuster," documentation checklist — factual assistance language, no outcome promises.

### 4.2 Commercial experience (new — equal emphasis)

Commercial buyers are not homeowners: they're property managers, facility directors, school boards, church committees, and owners' reps. Longer sales cycles, budget approvals, bid processes, maintenance contracts. The commercial experience is therefore **its own funnel**, not a re-skinned residential page.

**Commercial hub (/commercial) — the "commercial homepage":**
1. Commercial hero — building-owner messaging ("Protect your property, your tenants, and your budget"), CTA: **Request a Commercial Consultation** + direct line
2. Trust/credibility strip — commercial-relevant proof: bonding/insurance limits `[NEEDS: what's publishable]`, safety record `[NEEDS: real data]`, manufacturer commercial certifications `[NEEDS: real certs]`
3. Commercial services grid (replacement, repair, flat systems, metal, coatings, maintenance, inspections)
4. Industries served — six industry cards (schools, churches, apartments, industrial, warehouses, municipal)
5. Featured commercial projects / case-study cards `[NEEDS: commercial project history]`
6. Process for commercial clients — assessment → detailed proposal/spec → scheduling around operations → execution → maintenance plan
7. Why choose us for commercial — minimal disruption, documentation, communication with stakeholders
8. Commercial FAQ + final consultation CTA

**Commercial service pages** follow the core template but with commercial copy, flat/low-slope system detail, and the consultation CTA replacing "free inspection."

**Industry pages (/commercial/industries/*)** — the differentiator vs. local competitors:
1. Industry hero (e.g., "Roofing for Schools & Educational Facilities")
2. Industry-specific concerns (schools: summer scheduling, safety compliance, budget cycles; churches: steep-slope + architectural features, congregation fundraising timelines; apartments: tenant disruption, phased work; industrial/warehouse: large flat spans, downtime cost; municipal: bid/procurement processes `[NEEDS: confirm municipal bid experience]`)
3. Systems we recommend for this building type
4. Relevant case studies (as they accumulate)
5. Industry FAQ + consultation CTA

**Commercial lead flow (/commercial/request-consultation):** dedicated form — company, contact name/role, property type, property address, roof type (if known), approximate square footage, timeline, budget stage, description. Delivered with "commercial" tagging so the owner can triage. No instant-quote framing — commercial buyers expect a consultation.

**Case studies (/commercial/projects/[slug]):** challenge → solution → outcome format, system installed, timeline, photos; `[NEEDS: past commercial projects + client permission]`. Modeled as a CMS content type from day one.

### 4.3 Metal roofing hub (new — flagship category)

Metal gets its own hub because it's (a) a high-margin growth category, (b) a massive topical-authority opportunity (§10), and (c) both residential and commercial.

**Hub page (/metal-roofing):**
1. Cinematic metal hero (standing-seam imagery `[NEEDS: metal project photos]`)
2. Style explorer — cards for Standing Seam, Exposed Fastener (R-Panel/PBR), residential, commercial, agricultural/barndominium
3. Materials & specs section — 26 vs 29 gauge, Galvalume vs painted steel, panel profiles `[NEEDS: actual products/suppliers used]`
4. Metal vs shingle comparison block (honest, factual)
5. Metal gallery strip
6. Metal FAQ (lifespan, cost, noise myths, insurance benefits — factual only)
7. CTA: metal-specific estimate request

**Child pages** (rolling out Phases 3–4):

| Page | Focus |
|------|-------|
| /metal-roofing/standing-seam | Concealed-fastener systems, panel profiles, residential + commercial applications |
| /metal-roofing/exposed-fastener | R-Panel & PBR panels — cost-effective option, ag/commercial/residential uses |
| /metal-roofing/residential | Homeowner-focused: styles, colors, value, insurance considerations |
| /metal-roofing/commercial | Low-slope + architectural metal for commercial buildings |
| /metal-roofing/agricultural | Ag buildings, barns, barndominiums `[NEEDS: confirm barndo/ag capability]` |
| /metal-roofing/materials | Buyer's guide: gauge (26 vs 29), Galvalume, painted steel, finishes/warranties `[NEEDS: real product lines]` |

Deep-dive comparisons ("26 vs 29 gauge," "Galvalume vs painted") live in the Learning Center and link up to these pages — hub pages sell, learning pages rank and educate.

---

## 5. Service-Area SEO Strategy

**Model: hub-and-spoke, data-driven, uniqueness-enforced.** (Unchanged from v1 in structure; now CMS-driven and feeding the larger topical-authority plan in §10.)

- **Hub:** /service-areas — interactive map (§7), full city list, service-area overview.
- **Spokes:** one page per city from a CMS `location` document; adding city #15+ is a content entry, not a build.

**Tiers:**

| Tier | Cities | Depth |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Hattiesburg, Petal, Laurel, Gulfport, Biloxi | 800–1,200 words unique copy, neighborhoods/landmarks, city-specific FAQ, local projects |
| 2 | Purvis, Sumrall, Columbia, Ellisville, Richton, Seminary, Poplarville, Picayune, Diamondhead | 500–700 words unique copy, county + response-time context, rotated FAQ pool |

**Anti-doorway rules (critical):** genuinely local content on every page (county, landmarks, storm patterns, distance/response time, accumulating local projects); no find-and-replace body copy; Tier 2 ships in batches as unique copy completes — never thin.

**City page template:** hero + CTAs → unique local intro → services in {city} (linking mesh) → why locals choose us + response time → local projects slot → city FAQ (schema) → nearby areas → final CTA. Commercial note: Tier 1 city pages include a commercial section ("Commercial roofing in {city}") linking into the commercial funnel.

**Internal-linking mesh:** services ↔ cities, cities ↔ neighbors, footer carries both lists, Learning Center articles link down into service and city pages.

**Expansion path:** the CMS model reserves `service × city` combination pages — not built at launch; activated selectively later for proven high-value combos with unique copy (part of the 200+ page roadmap, §10).

**Google Business Profile:** site ↔ GBP linkage `[NEEDS: GBP access/URL]`; NAP identical site-wide, matching GBP exactly, sourced from one config record.

---

## 6. Brand / Design System

*(Carried forward from v1 — unchanged palette, typography, imagery, and UI rules. Summary below; full token table stands.)*

- **Palette:** charcoal foundation (`#0B0B0D` → `#26262C` scale), white/silver text (`#FFFFFF`, `#E6E8EB`, `#C7CBD1` metallic accent), burgundy accent scale (`#7A1F2B` primary, `#93293A` hover, `#5E1620` pressed). Metallic silver gradients used sparingly on headline words, card borders, dividers. All combinations WCAG AA.
- **Typography:** bold premium display sans (Archivo / Barlow Condensed direction) + Inter body, self-hosted via `next/font`, fluid `clamp()` scale, one H1 per page.
- **Imagery:** real project photography only on key pages `[NEEDS: photo library]`, consistent dark cinematic grading, AVIF/WebP via `next/image`, subtle grain texture on hero/CTA bands.
- **UI:** dark cards with 1px borders + silver hover glow, burgundy primary buttons / silver ghost secondary / pulsing emergency variant, 44px+ touch targets, dark forms with silver focus rings, Lucide icons (1.5px stroke), 96–160px section rhythm.
- **Commercial sub-brand note:** the commercial experience shares the design system but shifts tone — slightly more silver/steel, less burgundy; photography of large buildings and crews at scale; denser information layout appropriate for B2B readers. Same system, more boardroom.

---

## 7. Animation, Motion & Interactive Features

### 7.1 Motion system

*(Carried forward from v1 — unchanged.)* Lenis smooth scroll; Framer Motion for UI/reveals/transitions; GSAP + ScrollTrigger reserved for ≤2 scroll set pieces per page; CSS for micro-interactions. Motion vocabulary: 24–32px fade-rise reveals with 60–90ms stagger, ≤15% parallax, ≤6px hover lifts, ~1.2s count-ups, ≤300ms page transitions. Guardrails: transform/opacity only, server-rendered content never waits on animation JS, full `prefers-reduced-motion` support, hero text visible immediately.

### 7.2 Interactive feature roadmap (premium differentiators)

| Feature | Description | Phase |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Interactive service-area map** | Stylized dark SVG/vector map of South MS; hover/tap states per city; pins animate in on scroll; cities link to their pages | 5 |
| **Animated 2-hour radius** | On the map: a radius ring animating out from Hattiesburg communicating "if you're in this circle, we've got you" | 5 |
| **Before/after sliders** | Draggable, touch-friendly, transform-only comparison sliders | 2 |
| **Advanced project gallery** | Filterable by service / city / material / residential-commercial; animated filtering (FLIP), lightbox with keyboard nav | 6 |
| **Interactive quote wizard** (/quote) | Multi-step animated wizard: property type → service → roof details → photos (optional) → contact. Progress indicator, step transitions, saves partial state. Feeds the same lead pipeline with rich data | 8 |
| **Financing calculator** | Slider-driven monthly-payment estimator on /financing `[NEEDS: real financing terms — no invented rates; ships only when partner terms are known]` | 8 |
| **Storm Center** (/storm-center) | Activated during weather events: current storm info, "what to do now" checklist, emergency contact, insurance-claim starter, post-storm inspection scheduling. Toggleable site-wide banner drives to it | 8 |
| **Roofing Learning Center** (/learn) | Filterable, categorized educational library with pillar pages and reading-time UI — the topical-authority engine (§10) | 7 |
| **AI customer assistant** | Chat assistant grounded on CMS content (services, FAQs, learning articles) for instant answers + lead capture. Claude API; requires content maturity first | 8+ |

Every interactive feature obeys the motion guardrails and ships only when it can be fast, accessible, and honest (the calculator especially).

---

## 8. Lead-Generation Strategy

### 8.1 Two funnels

**Residential funnel** — high volume, fast decisions:
- Primary offer: **Free Roof Inspection**; secondary: free replacement estimate, emergency response, claims review
- CTAs on every page: Call Now (tel:) `[NEEDS: phone]`, Schedule Free Inspection, short embedded quote form, emergency CTA where relevant, financing + insurance CTAs, sticky mobile call bar
- Short form: name, phone, city/zip, service (10-second completion). Full form on /free-inspection and /contact: + address, preferred time, storm/insurance flag, message; photo upload phase 2

**Commercial funnel** — lower volume, higher value, longer cycle:
- Primary offer: **Commercial Roof Consultation** (assessment + written proposal)
- /commercial/request-consultation form per §4.2, tagged separately in delivery
- Secondary assets that nurture: case studies, industry pages, maintenance-program page
- Direct line prominently displayed — commercial buyers call

### 8.2 Lead pipeline (platform-ready)

- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod, inline validation, honeypot + invisible Turnstile, explicit success state with "what happens next"
- **Intake architecture:** form → server action / `/api/lead` → **lead service layer** that (a) stores the lead, (b) emails notification `[NEEDS: lead email]`, (c) fires optional webhooks. The webhook/adapter layer is how CRM and project-management integrations (JobNimbus, AccuLynx, Zapier…) attach later without touching forms `[NEEDS: current lead workflow]`
- Residential and commercial leads carry a `channel` tag end-to-end

### 8.3 Measurement

- GA4 + events: form submits (by channel), tel: clicks, CTA clicks, wizard step completion (later), scroll depth on money pages
- Call tracking `[NEEDS: decision — recommendation: single clean number at launch for NAP consistency; revisit dynamic tracking later]`
- /free-inspection and /commercial/request-consultation double as ad landing pages; UTM discipline

---

## 9. Technical Architecture

### 9.1 Stack

- **Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript**, SSG/ISR for all marketing pages
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**, tokens mapped to the design system
- **Framer Motion + GSAP/ScrollTrigger + Lenis** per §7
- **Lucide, React Hook Form, Zod**
- **Sanity CMS** (recommendation §9.3) for structured content
- **Vercel** — both domains attached; roofs.ms → southeastroofing.llc 301 at domain level; `SITE_URL` env var is the single canonical-host source (§1)

### 9.2 Application structure (platform-ready)

```

- **Route groups** separate marketing from the future platform area — the portal arrives later without disturbing the public site. Auth (Clerk or NextAuth) and a database (Vercel Postgres/Neon) are introduced **only when the first platform feature ships**; nothing pays that complexity cost now.
- **company/NAP singleton** in CMS + `config/site.ts` = single source of truth for name/address/phone/hours/license across footer, contact, schema.
- **Feature flags** (storm banner, storm center, wizard) let the owner toggle features from the CMS without deploys where appropriate.

### 9.3 CMS evaluation: Sanity vs Payload

| Criterion | Sanity | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| Hosting/ops | Fully managed (content lake + CDN); zero database to run | Self-hosted in the Next.js app; requires Postgres/Mongo you own (Neon/Supabase/Payload Cloud) |
| Editing experience | Sanity Studio — polished, real-time, customizable; excellent for a non-technical owner | Solid admin UI, TypeScript-native; slightly more "developer tool" feel |
| Structured content / SEO | First-class structured content, strong references/relations — ideal for service×city×material relationships that drive the 200+ page plan | Equally capable structurally; content lives in your DB |
| Images | Built-in image CDN with on-the-fly transforms (pairs well with next/image) | You manage storage (S3/UploadThing) + transforms |
| Cost at this scale | Generous free tier; small business likely free/cheap for years | Software free/open-source; you pay for DB + storage hosting |
| Ownership | Content lives in Sanity's cloud (exportable) | Full ownership, everything in your repo/DB |
| Platform future (portals, scheduling) | CMS stays content-only; app DB added separately later (clean separation) | Could double as app DB/backend later (one system) |
| Risk profile | Vendor dependency (mitigated by export) | You own uptime, backups, migrations |

**Recommendation: Sanity.**

Rationale for Southeast Roofing specifically:
1. **Ease of use wins** — the owner (non-developer) will add projects, reviews, city pages, and articles for years. Sanity Studio is the best non-technical editing experience of the two.
2. **Zero ops** — no database to babysit, back up, or migrate. For a roofing company, that's not a hobby worth having; managed infrastructure is worth the (currently ~zero) cost.
3. **Image pipeline** — a photo-heavy site gets Sanity's image CDN and transforms for free; with Payload we'd assemble storage + optimization ourselves.
4. **SEO content velocity** — the 200+ page topical-authority plan lives or dies on how easy it is to publish structured content. Sanity's references (a guide links a service, a material, and three cities) make the internal-linking mesh queryable and enforceable.
5. **Clean platform separation** — when the customer portal arrives, application data (users, projects, schedules) belongs in an app database anyway. Sanity for content + app DB for platform is a cleaner long-term architecture than stretching one CMS into both roles.

Payload would be the pick if full data ownership in-repo were a hard requirement or if we wanted the CMS to double as the platform backend. Neither outweighs ease-of-use + zero-ops for this business. **Decision point for owner: approve Sanity or request Payload.**

### 9.4 Rendering, performance, quality

*(Carried forward from v1.)* Static generation + ISR for CMS-driven pages (content publishes without full redeploys); Server Components by default, client islands only for interactivity; `next/image` + `next/font`; GSAP/Lenis dynamically imported. **Budgets: LCP < 2.0s, CLS < 0.05, INP < 200ms (throttled mobile); Lighthouse ≥ 90 on money pages — enforced per phase.** ESLint/Prettier/TS-strict, CI on GitHub, Vercel preview deploys, semantic landmarks + skip link + WCAG AA, custom 404, error boundaries.

## 10. SEO — Long-Term Topical Authority Plan (200+ pages)

### 10.1 Strategy

Local roofing SEO is won by being the **most complete, most local, most trustworthy answer** in the region. The plan builds four topical clusters, each anchored by pillar pages, interlinked down to service/city money pages:

1. **Residential roofing** (pillar: /services + roof-replacement cost guide)
2. **Commercial roofing** (pillar: /commercial — the biggest local content gap; competitors barely cover it)
3. **Metal roofing** (pillar: /metal-roofing — highest topical-authority upside; barndominium and gauge/material queries have real volume and weak local competition)
4. **Storm, insurance & maintenance** (pillar: storm-damage + insurance-claims pages, later Storm Center)

### 10.2 The 200+ page roadmap

| Content type | Pages (approx.) | Phase(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Core/residential service pages | 10 | 3 |
| Metal roofing hub + children | 7 | 3–4 |
| Commercial hub + services + industries + lead page | 15 | 4 |
| City pages (launch set) | 14 | 5 |
| City pages (expansion ring: e.g. Wiggins, Lucedale, Waynesboro, Collins, Mendenhall, Brookhaven, McComb, Bay St. Louis, Ocean Springs, Pascagoula, Mobile-line communities…) | +16 | 5→ongoing |
| Service × city combination pages (selective, high-value only — e.g. "metal roofing Hattiesburg," "commercial roofing Gulfport") | 30–40 | 7–8, data-justified |
| Learning Center — material & buying guides (gauge comparisons, Galvalume vs painted, shingle brand guides, TPO vs EPDM, metal vs shingle cost, roof lifespan in MS climate…) | 25–30 | 7→ongoing |
| Learning Center — insurance & storm education (claim walkthroughs, deductible law facts, hurricane prep, hail/wind damage identification…) | 20–25 | 7→ongoing |
| Learning Center — maintenance & homeowner education | 15–20 | 7→ongoing |
| Learning Center — commercial education (flat-roof systems, maintenance programs, budgeting/capital planning for facility managers…) | 15–20 | 7→ongoing |
| Blog (news, storm updates, completed-project stories) | 30+ | 7→ongoing |
| Project case studies (residential + commercial) | 20+ | 6→ongoing |
| **Total trajectory** | **215–250+** | ~24–36 months |

### 10.3 Editorial rules

- Every page earns its existence: unique intent, unique copy, a real query behind it. No page ships to hit a count.
- Pillar → cluster → money-page linking is mandatory and modeled in the CMS (every guide references its related service, material, and cities).
- E-E-A-T: articles carry real author attribution (owner/company), real photos, real local specifics; review/refresh cycle for top pages annually.
- Publishing cadence target after Phase 7: 4–8 quality pages/month `[NEEDS: decision — who writes: owner-supplied expertise + drafting support, or contracted]`.

### 10.4 Schema plan

| Page | JSON-LD |
|------|---------|
| All pages | `RoofingContractor` (name, URL, phone, address `[NEEDS: publishable?]`, geo, hours, areaServed, sameAs, license when supplied) |
| Homepage | + `WebSite`, `Organization` |
| Service/metal/commercial-service pages | + `Service` + `FAQPage` + `BreadcrumbList` |
| Industry pages | + `Service` (audience-scoped) + `FAQPage` + `BreadcrumbList` |
| City pages | + `Service` areaServed-scoped + `FAQPage` + `BreadcrumbList` |
| Case studies / projects | + `ImageObject` galleries; case-study `Article` schema |
| Learning Center / blog | + `Article` (+ `HowTo` where genuinely procedural) + `BreadcrumbList` |
| Reviews | + `AggregateRating`/`Review` **only with real, verifiable reviews** |
| Careers | + `JobPosting` (when real listings exist) |

### 10.5 Metadata & indexing

*(Carried forward from v1.)* Title pattern `{Topic} | Southeast Roofing — {City/Region}` ≤ 60 chars; unique ~150-char descriptions; canonical everywhere (host from `SITE_URL`); branded dynamic OG images; one H1 per page; descriptive contextual alt text; auto-generated sitemap.xml + robots.txt (reserved routes noindexed); breadcrumbs on all interior pages; Search Console on both domains, sitemap submitted for primary.

## 12. Content Needed From Owner (the `[NEEDS]` list)

**Identity & legal:** logo (vector) or logo-design decision · MS contractor license # (public form) · insurance/bonding language safe to publish · legal entity name · year founded

**Contact & operations:** primary phone (+ emergency line?) · lead email(s) · address publishable vs service-area-only · hours + real 24/7 availability · GBP URL/access · social profiles · current lead workflow/CRM

**Proof & credibility:** real reviews + permission · manufacturer certifications actually held (residential and commercial) · real warranty terms · real awards/memberships · defensible stats (roofs completed, etc.) · safety record/EMR if publishable (commercial)

**Media:** 30–50 best project photos (before/after pairs are gold) · commercial project photos · metal roofing photos (standing seam especially) · team/crew/truck photos · drone/video footage

**Business decisions:**
1. Confirm commercial systems offered (TPO? EPDM? coatings? maintenance programs?)
2. Confirm metal capabilities (standing seam? ag/barndominium? which panel lines/suppliers?)
3. Confirm Roof Cleaning / "Roof Revive" offering
4. Financing: offered today? partner? terms safe to state?
5. Municipal/government bid experience (yes/no — affects municipal page claims)
6. Call-tracking decision (recommendation: single number at launch)
7. **CMS approval: Sanity (recommended) or Payload (§9.3)**
8. Content authorship model for the 200+ page plan (§10.3)

Development is not blocked on the full list — phone, lead email, logo, and photos unblock the most, earliest.

## 13. Development Phases

**Phase 1 — Foundation**
Next.js + TS + Tailwind + shadcn/ui scaffold; design tokens + fonts; `SITE_URL` config + domain-agnostic SEO utilities; Vercel project with both domains (existing redirect direction preserved: roofs.ms → southeastroofing.llc); Sanity Studio + core schemas (service, location, project, case study, guide, post, FAQ, company singleton, flags); lead service layer (store + email + webhook stub); layout shell (header/footer/sticky CTAs); CI.
*Exit: deployed skeleton on southeastroofing.llc; CMS editable; lead pipeline works end-to-end.*

**Phase 2 — Homepage**
All 17 homepage sections; motion foundation (Lenis, Reveal/Stagger, hero parallax, count-ups, before/after slider); /free-inspection + /contact with working forms; GA4 + conversion events.
*Exit: the site converts. Lighthouse ≥ 90 mobile on home + form pages.*

**Phase 3 — Core Service Pages**
Services hub + 10 core service pages (unique copy); metal-roofing hub page + first children (standing-seam, materials); FAQ system + schema; emergency page + storm-banner flag; insurance & financing pages.
*Exit: full residential service coverage indexed and conversion-complete.*

**Phase 4 — Commercial Roofing**
Commercial hub; commercial service pages; six industry pages; /commercial/request-consultation flow with tagged delivery; commercial case-study template (+ first case studies as content allows); remaining metal children (commercial, agricultural, exposed-fastener, residential).
*Exit: the dedicated commercial funnel is live — equal footing with residential.*

**Phase 5 — Local SEO**
Service-areas hub + interactive map + 2-hour radius animation; Tier 1 city pages (full unique copy); Tier 2 in batches; internal-linking mesh + breadcrumbs; sitemap/robots finalization; GBP alignment; Search Console on both domains.
*Exit: hub-and-spoke local SEO system live and indexed.*

**Phase 6 — Gallery & Reviews**
Advanced filterable project gallery (residential + commercial, FLIP animations, lightbox); project case-study pages; /reviews with real reviews; /about; /careers (basic); remaining motion set pieces; dynamic OG images; full CWV + accessibility audit.
*Exit: proof layer complete; every remaining `[NEEDS]` either filled or consciously deferred.*

**Phase 7 — Blog & Learning Center**
/learn hub with categories + pillar pages; /blog; Article/HowTo schema; RelatedContent linking mesh; author/E-E-A-T framework; editorial workflow in Sanity; first content wave (per §10 roadmap); publishing cadence begins.
*Exit: the topical-authority engine is running; owner can publish without developer help.*

**Phase 8 — Future Platform Features**
Sequenced by business value, each its own mini-project: interactive quote wizard (/quote) → financing calculator (real terms only) → Storm Center → selective service×city pages (data-justified) → CRM/PM webhook integrations → AI customer assistant (grounded on mature CMS content) → customer portal → employee portal → online scheduling (auth + app DB arrive here).
*Exit: rolling — this phase is the 5-year platform runway.*
